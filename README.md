# Tiny Solar Power Supply – PCB Design

This repository contains my PCB design for the **Tiny Solar Power Supply** circuit, originally designed by **Clemens Valens** and published in **Elektor Magazine**.

## Project Overview
The Tiny Solar Power Supply is a compact and efficient power source designed to run low-consumption devices using solar energy.  
It uses a solar panel to charge an energy storage element (such as a supercapacitor or rechargeable battery) and provides a stable output voltage.

## My Contribution
For this project, I:
- Designed a **custom PCB layout** using **KiCad**
- Optimized track routing for better efficiency and minimal noise
- Added silkscreen labels for easier assembly
- Prepared Gerber files for PCB manufacturing

## Repository Contents
- `KiCad_Project/` – PCB design files
- `Gerber_Files/` – Manufacturing files for the PCB
